  The RECOMB Conference needs Sites for 1998, 1999, and 2000.
     As reserving hotels in some locations requires arrangements
<br>
     made one or two years in advance, we are soliciting proposals
      now for the next sites.
<br>     
     Please send us email with proposals for locations for the 
     next RECOMB both in US as well as outside US. 
<br>
At the RECOMB 97
     business meeting we will discuss these matters in detail.
