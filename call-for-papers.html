The First Annual Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology
(RECOMB 97), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) with support from the SLOAN 
Foundation, 
and US Department of Energy will be held in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico, January 20--23, 1997. Papers reporting on original 
research (both theoretical and experimental) in all areas of computational 
molecular biology are sought, including surveys of important recent 
results/directions. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include: 

<ul>Genomics</ul>
<ul> Molecular sequence analysis</ul>
<ul> Recognition of  genes and regulatory elements</ul>
<ul> Molecular evolution</ul>
<ul> Protein structure</ul>
<ul> Combinatorial libraries and drug design</ul>
<ul> DNA computing</ul>

<h2>ABSTRACT SUBMISSION</h2>

Authors are requested to send 10 copies 
(preferably two sided copies) of a detailed extended 
abstract (5-10 pages) to:

<h3>An abstract must be received by August 10, 1996.(<blink>New 
Submission Deadline</blink>)</h3>
This is a firm deadline. Simultaneous submission to another conference or 
journal is allowed. 



<h2>CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS</h2>
The extended abstracts for the Conference will be published by ACM Press 
and will be available at the Conference. 
A selection of the accepted extended abstracts in their final journal 
versions will be invited to appear in a special issue of the Journal of 
Computational Biology devoted to RECOMB 97. 

<br>
<h2>NOTIFICATION</h2>

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by a letter mailed on 
or before October 10, 1996.  A final copy of each accepted paper is 
required by November 10, 1996. An author of each accepted paper is expected  
to attend the Symposium and present the paper; otherwise alternative 
arrangements should be made to have the paper presented.
Limited financial support for the authors of the accepted papers will be  
available. 

<br>

<h2>ABSTRACT PREPARATION</h2>

An abstract should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous
work. This material should be understandable to nonspecialists. A
technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The
length, excluding cover page and bibliography, should not exceed 10
pages.  The manuscript should be easy to read, preferably using 11 point
font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper.  If authors believe
that more details are necessary to substantiate the claims of the
paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix. 
An E-mail address for the contact author should be included.
